/// The selector objects available to filter returned data.
///
/// `Selector` objects define what data the API returns when fetching resources.
/// You use selector objects with find calls and reporting endpoints.
/// | Functionality | Description |
/// | --- | --- |
/// | Filtering | Specifies the criteria to filter the resources that return. |
/// | Sorting | Specifies the criteria to order the resources that return. |
/// | Paginating | Specifies the page segment of resources that return. |
///
/// You can also use `Selector` objects to find archived or soft-deleted campaigns.
/// By default, API fetch calls donâ€™t return deleted resources, with the exception of GET by a resource Id.
/// To retrieve deleted resources, you must explicitly request the call using the selector `Condition`:
/// ```json
/// {
///   "conditions": [
///     {
///       "field": "deleted",
///       "operator": "IN",
///       "values": ["true", "false"]
///     }
///   ]
/// }
/// ```
